# CAB-DRIVER-ASSISTANCE

From the nexus of busy streets and artificial intelligence, salutations from the urban mobility of the future. We apply notions of reinforcement learning to the field of taxi driver support in this novel work. Imagine a world where cabs are run at previously unheard-of levels of efficiency, where they can instantly adjust to traffic circumstances, choose the best routes, and make sure every customer has the best possible experience. This technology not only revolutionizes the taxi service sector but also improves sustainability, lessens traffic, and increases city safety. Come along as we investigate how algorithms might become adept at navigating the complexities of urban life, turning taxi driving into a knowledgeable and flexible experience that serves the interests of both drivers and patrons. 

Throughout the day, the majority of drivers in this cutthroat industry receive a respectable number of rides from clients. However, a lot of drivers are complaining that even while their revenue is rising, their profits are not, because to the recent increases in gas and electricity rates. Drivers can optimize their daily earnings by selecting the appropriate rides, which is a crucial decision. In our research, we are helping taxi drivers optimize their earnings by utilizing Reinforcement Learning. 

The objective of our research is to develop an RL-based algorithm that will enable taxi drivers to make better decisions while they are out in the field, hence increasing their earnings. 

EXAMPLE 

At 3 PM, for instance, a driver might receive three requests for rides. The first one will take him to a place where it is unlikely that he will find another ride for the next few hours, but it is a long-distance ride that guarantees a high cost. Although the second one ends up in a better place, he has to make a small detour to pick up the customer, which increases the cost of gasoline. Choosing option number three might be the greatest option because, despite its medium distance, it will probably find him another ride later on and spare him from most of the traffic.
